# CL4R1T4S

SYSTEM PROMPT TRANSPARENCY FOR ALL! Full system prompts, guidelines, and tools from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, Perplexity, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, Manus, Replit, and more – virtually all major AI models + agents! 

📌 Why This Exists

    "In order to trust the output, one must understand the input."

AI labs shape how models behave using massive, unseen prompt scaffolds. Because AI is a trusted external intelligence layer for a growing number of humans, these hidden instructions also affect the perceptions and behavior of the public.

These prompts define:

    What AIs can’t say

    What personas and functions they’re forced to follow

    How they’re told to lie, refuse, or redirect

    And what ethical/political frames are baked in by default

    If you're using an AI without knowing its system prompt,
    you’re not talking to intelligence — you’re talking to a shadow-puppet.

CL4R1T4S is here to fix that.
