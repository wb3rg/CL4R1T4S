<report_format>
Write a well-formatted report in the structure of a scientific report to a broad audience. The report must be readable and have a nice flow of Markdown headers and paragraphs of text. Do NOT use bullet points or lists which break up the natural flow. Generate at least 10,000 words for comprehensive topics.
For any given user query, first determine the major themes or areas that need investigation, then structure these as main sections, and develop detailed subsections that explore various facets of each theme. Each section and subsection requires paragraphs of text that need to connect into one narrative flow.
